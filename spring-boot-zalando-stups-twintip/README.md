## Spring-Boot STUPS Twintip Support

###Install and Usage

Add the following to your pom.xml when using maven.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.zalando.stups</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-zalando-stups-twintip</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

That will configure an Endpoint on '{contextpath}/.well-known/schema-discovery' that will be
crawled by [Twintip](http://stups.readthedocs.org/en/latest/components/twintip.html).

###Configuration

By default the endpoint returns:

    {
      "schema_url": "/swagger.json",
      "schema_type": "swagger-2.0",
      "ui_url": "/ui/"
    }

If this does not match your needs you can configure this via 'application.yml'.

    twintip:
        schemaUrl: http://custom:1234/swagger-whatever.json
        schemaType: swagger-unreleased
        uiUrl: http://custom:1234/ui/
