Goal of this project is to provide some small libraries maybe useful in your Spring-Boot projects.

Most of them use "Spring-Boot's magic of AutoConfiguration".

Drop the dependency into your _pom.xml_ or _build.gradle_ and do nothing more or just a little bit of configuration in the _application.yml/application.properties._

That's it. Enjoy.
