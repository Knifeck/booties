Goal of this project is to provide some small libraries maybe useful in your Spring-Boot projects.

Most of them use "Spring-Boot's" magic of "AutoConfiguration".

Drop the dependency into your pom.xml or build.gradle and do nothing or just a little bit of configuration in the application.yml/application.properties.

That's it. Enjoy.
